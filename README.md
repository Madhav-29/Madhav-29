## 💼 About Me

I’m a Data Engineer and Data Science graduate student with 2+ years of industry experience at Tamana Software, where I designed and owned scalable ETL pipelines, analytics workflows, and cloud-based data platforms on AWS. My work focused on transforming large, complex datasets into reliable, ML-ready data that supported forecasting, reporting, and business decision-making.

I have a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and data engineering best practices, and I’ve built interactive dashboards and automated data pipelines that improved processing efficiency, data quality, and stakeholder trust. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, maintainable code, meaningful visualizations, and close collaboration with data scientists and business teams. My current focus is on predictive analytics, workflow automation, and building end-to-end data solutions that scale.
